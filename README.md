# BMI calculator
BMI Calculator is a simple web project built to practise using formulas in JavaScript. Users can input their weight and height, and the calculator will apply the standard Body Mass Index formula to determine their BMI.

Depending on the result, a message is displayed offering a light, encouraging comment tailored to the BMI range. The focus is on practising calculations and conditional logic while keeping the tone friendly and supportive.

This project is ideal for reinforcing my understanding of basic math operations, user input handling, and conditional branching.
